# Sony-IR-Codes

These IR codes have been recorded from working remote controller for these models :

- TV : remote controller model => RM-ED054
- Bluray : remote controller model => RMT-VB100I

I used the Arduino sketch ReceiveDemo from the IRRemote library

With these informations you will be able to build your own controller with an MCU and IR led emitter

Hope this will help someone else ...
